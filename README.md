## Implementation of Machine Learning algorithm from scratch
---

- Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 

- A computer is said to be learning from Experiences with respect to some class of Tasks, if its performance in a given Task improves with the Experience.A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E

- In this project we have implemented a supervised learning algorithm and an unsupervised learning algorithm from scratch and have compared their results with inbuilt implementation using scikit-learn.

- Supervised learning is a learning in which we teach or train the machine using data which is well labeled that means some data is already tagged with the correct answer.

- Unsupervised learning is the training of machine using information that is neither classified nor labeled and allowing the algorithm to act on that information without guidance. Here the task of machine is to group unsorted information according to similarities, patterns and differences without any prior training of data.

- for Supervised Learning we have taken KNN .
- for Unsupervised Learning we have taken K means Clustering.
