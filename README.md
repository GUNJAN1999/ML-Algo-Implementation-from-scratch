## Implementation of Machine Learning algorithm from scratch
---

- Machine Learning is the field of study that gives computers the capability to learn without being explicitly programmed. 

- A computer is said to be learning from Experiences with respect to some class of Tasks, if its performance in a given Task improves with the Experience.A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and performance measure P, if its performance at tasks in T, as measured by P, improves with experience E

-In this project we have implemented a supervised learning algorithm and an unsupervised learning algorithm from scratch and have compared their results with inbuilt implementation using scikit-learn.

- for Supervised Learning we have taken KNN .
- for Unsupervised Learning we have taken K means Clustering.
